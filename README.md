WORA
Write Once Run Anywhere

Not have haredcoded strings for environment / tools, whatnot.



`apple, alt, shift, L` => format code


`Extract Interface` => extracts the interface


The point of spring is dependency injection => to get testing going / separation of concearns

configures via XML (first method, and the most used still)

applicationContext.xml contains the hashMap of the injection in the resources.

a bean in the spring xml defines the injection in the classes. Defining a bean is like using the keyword `new`, mentioning the interface that it is used.
